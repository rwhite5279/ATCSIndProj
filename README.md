# ATCSIndProj
This is my final project for the 2024 Advanced Topics in CS course at Polytechnic School

## 2024-05-09
Got a little bit of work done researching, but I'm still not sure what I'm going to focus on:

* Learning C
* Learning some Machine Learning
* Finishing up an application using Vertex and Graph objects.

I'll know more by the time we meet next!
